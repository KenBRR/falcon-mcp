RTR_ADMIN_TOOL_USE_GUIDE = """RTR Admin Tool Use Guide

This guide explains how to use the RTR Admin module tools. RTR Admin can affect
live endpoints. Use standard RTR for read-only host triage and use this module
only when an admin command, script execution, or put-file workflow is actually
needed.

=== Recommended workflow ===

1. Review available reusable material.
   - Use `falcon_search_rtr_admin_scripts` for custom cloud scripts.
   - Use `falcon_search_rtr_falcon_scripts` for CrowdStrike-provided scripts.
   - Use `falcon_search_rtr_put_files` for put-file inventory.
   - Treat script inventory responses as sensitive because they can include
     full custom or Falcon script content.
   - Use `falcon_get_rtr_put_file_contents` only after selecting a specific
     put-file ID. Treat returned content as potentially sensitive operational
     material.
   - Do not rely on put-file inventory `file_type` to predict content exposure.
     Inventory can report `file_type: binary` while the content retrieval
     endpoint returns text script content.
   - Falcon script ID filters are supported. Custom script and put-file ID
     filters may be API-dependent; prefer broader filters and compare returned
     IDs manually before acting on a selected record.
   - For put-files, prefer exact `name:'...'` filters when the name is known.
     Contains or wildcard name filters may return no rows; use time-bounded
     inventory and compare names client-side when exact name is not known.
   - Platform casing differs: custom scripts use values such as
     `platform:'windows'`, while Falcon scripts use values such as
     `platform:'Windows'`.

2. Classify the intended command locally.
   - Use `falcon_classify_rtr_admin_command` before execution planning.
   - This does not call Falcon.
   - Classification is enforced before execution. High-impact commands require
     an explicit operator approval phrase before any Falcon call is made.

3. Preview the exact payload.
   - Use `falcon_preview_rtr_admin_command` before live execution.
   - For group work, initialize and review a batch with
     `falcon_init_rtr_batch_session`, then use
     `falcon_preview_rtr_admin_batch_command` with a human-readable
     `target_summary`.
   - Provide `reason`, `ticket`, and `expected_effect` whenever possible.
   - Confirm `base_command` matches the first token of `command_string`;
     mismatches are rejected locally before any Falcon call.
   - Keep direct RTR Admin command strings to one RTR command when possible.
     Shell/control separators such as `&&`, `||`, `;`, and `|` are called out
     in approval packet review and require high-impact approval outside
     `runscript` payloads.
   - Review `payload_preview`, `classification`, `missing_context`,
     `approval_gate`, and any command-specific guidance.
   - For `reg query`, keep the query shape minimal. Falcon can reject extra
     unquoted arguments with HTTP 400.
   - If `approval_gate.approval_required` is true, ask the operator to approve
     the exact target, command, expected effect, and approval hash before
     re-submitting with `operator_approval`.
   - High-impact approval is only ready when `device_id`, `reason`, `ticket`,
     and `expected_effect` are present. The approval phrase binds the target,
     payload, and audit context.
   - For batch commands, high-impact approval is only ready when `batch_id`,
     `target_summary`, `reason`, `ticket`, and `expected_effect` are present.
   - Single-host approval phrases intentionally bind to the stable `device_id`
     and command intent, not the volatile RTR `session_id`, so an approved
     packet can survive a session refresh or re-init for the same host.

4. Execute only after target and effect review.
   - Use `falcon_execute_rtr_admin_command` for one host/session.
   - Use `falcon_execute_rtr_admin_batch_command` for a reviewed RTR batch.
     Pass `optional_hosts` when only a subset of hosts in the batch should be
     impacted.
   - Use `falcon_run_rtr_admin_command_and_wait` when you want a focused
     single-host command to submit once and return combined stdout/stderr after
     polling. It uses the same classification and approval gate as the execution
     tool.
   - This execution tool is marked destructive because submitted commands can
     change or disrupt endpoints depending on the command string.
   - High-impact commands such as `runscript`, `rm`, `put`, `kill`, restart or
     shutdown actions, registry writes, and memory dumps return an
     approval-required response unless `operator_approval` matches the exact
     phrase for that payload.
   - For directory cleanup, use `rm <directory> -force` and verify stderr/stdout
     before assuming deletion succeeded.

5. Poll output.
   - Use `falcon_check_rtr_admin_command_status` with the returned
     `cloud_request_id`.
   - The wait helper handles this polling for simple workflows; manual polling
     remains useful for long-running commands or when the caller needs each
     status chunk.
   - Start with `sequence_id=0`; if the status response includes a
     `sequence_id`, use that returned sequence_id on the next poll.
   - For batch admin command responses, review returned per-host command
     records and poll any returned `cloud_request_id` values individually.

6. Keep sessions alive while approval is pending.
   - Use `falcon_pulse_rtr_session` for a single host/session.
   - Use `falcon_refresh_rtr_batch_session` for a batch. RTR batch sessions
     expire quickly, so refresh them before executing after a long approval
     pause or reinitialize the batch and re-preview if the host set changed.

=== Raw runscript workflow ===

- Use `base_command="runscript"`.
- Use `falcon://rtr-admin/commands/runscript-guide` for quoting and
  controller notes.
- Treat `runscript -Raw` as submit-and-poll execution, not an interactive
  terminal.
- Prefer `runscript -CloudFile="ScriptName" -CommandLine="<arguments>"` for
  reusable or multiline scripts.

=== Boundaries and disclaimers ===

- This module retrieves put-file contents by explicit ID but does not upload,
  update, or delete script / put-file records.
- Do not use automated live tests for endpoint-changing commands. Tests should
  stay mocked, smoke-only, or read-only unless the operator chooses a specific
  PC for that run.
- Keep single-host `persist` false unless the operator explicitly wants offline
  execution when a host returns to service.
- Keep batch `persist_all` false unless the operator explicitly wants offline
  execution when hosts return to service.
- If audit/session searches return 403 during an RTR Admin investigation,
  verify the API client has `real-time-response-audit:read`.
- Do not place RTR controller actions such as status polling, `get`, `put`, or
  session cleanup inside raw script bodies. Use the separate MCP tools for those
  steps.

RTR_ADMIN_RUNSCRIPT_RAW_GUIDE = """RTR Admin runscript raw command guide

Use this guide when building command strings for
`falcon_execute_rtr_admin_command` or `falcon_run_rtr_admin_command_and_wait`
with `base_command="runscript"`.

CORE SHAPE:
- base_command: runscript
- command_string: runscript -Raw=```<target-side script>```

EXAMPLES:
- Windows process list: runscript -Raw=```Get-Process```
- Windows command wrapper: runscript -Raw=```cmd /c whoami && hostname```
- Linux/macOS shell: runscript -Raw=```/bin/sh -c 'id; hostname'```

CLOUD SCRIPT SHAPE:
- command_string: runscript -CloudFile="ScriptName"
- with arguments: runscript -CloudFile="ScriptName" -CommandLine="<arguments>"

IMPORTANT CONTROLLER NOTES:
- `runscript -Raw` is not an interactive terminal. Each tool call submits one
  RTR Admin command and returns a `cloud_request_id`.
- Shell/control separators are safest inside an approved target-side
  `runscript` payload. If they appear in direct RTR Admin command strings such
  as `ps` or `reg query`, the approval packet must call them out explicitly.
- Use `falcon_check_rtr_admin_command_status` to poll command output chunks, or
  use `falcon_run_rtr_admin_command_and_wait` for focused commands where direct
  stdout/stderr output is preferred.
- Do not put RTR controller commands such as `get`, `put`, `cd`, or status
  polling inside the raw script. Those are RTR commands, not target-side shell
  commands.
- If the target-side script needs to coordinate multiple steps, write explicit
  stdout markers or output files, then use separate RTR commands to retrieve or
  inspect results.
- Raw scripts are quoting-sensitive. Prefer short one-liners or approved cloud
  scripts for long multiline logic.
- Avoid unescaped triple backticks inside the script body because they delimit
  the raw payload.
- Prefer `-CloudFile` plus `-CommandLine` for reusable or complex scripts.
- Keep single-host `persist` false unless the operator explicitly wants offline
  execution when the host returns to service.
